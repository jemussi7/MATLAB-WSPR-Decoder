# MATLAB-WSPR-Decoder
This project involves using Matlab to record audio signal data, sychronise and decode wspr messages. I have used my own algorithm and built in matlab functions to capture the audio, sync and identify candidate signal frequencies. The channel symbol decoding algorithm is provided Refernece credit to Dr. Jonathon Y. Cheah (NZ0C) whose code is derived in turn from from the original wsprd.c code, part of program wsprd, a detector/demodulator/decoder  for the Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR) mode.    File name: wsprd.c    Copyright 2001-2018, Joe Taylor, K1JT    Much of the present code is based on work by Steven Franke, K9AN,  which in turn was based on earlier work by K1JT 
Matlab scripts were created and executed in R2017a.
